# This is a Calculator
It is my practice program on Javascript.
For this project i used **[Newton-API](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api)** to calculate logarithms.

Working on this project, i learnd:
1. What is a function and how can i us it, for example:
        
        ` const number1 = 3
          const number2 = 4
          let result = ""

          const myFunction = () => {
            result = number1 + number2
            return result
          }

          console.log(myFunction()) // 7
        `
Function also can have parameters
